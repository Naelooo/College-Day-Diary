        <p>Asian Computer Institute (ACI), the precursor of Asian College of Technology (ACT), was established on September 19, 1988 in the busy street of historic Colon at the heart of the booming City of Cebu. Under the unrelenting leadership of its hands-on founder Rodrigo A. Abellanosa, the Institute blazed its way to become the primary provider of computer literacy of the corporate workforce in Cebu and nearby provinces which at the time were only starting to embrace the use of computer technology in the offices.

            The school was incorporated on May 14, 1992 as Asian College of Technology, Inc., paving the way for the offering of post-secondary and collegiate courses that pioneered on hands-on oriented computer science curriculum.
            
            Asian College of Technology expanded its educational programs to the south of Cebu and Cebu City with the establishment of ACT - South Campus in 1992. At present, the Campus hosts the Integrated School composed of students from Preschool to Senior High School.
            
            The ACT Integrated School (ACT-IS) was established in 1996 to integrate the preschool (playgroup, nursery, and kindergarten), grade school and high school curricula.
            
            In 2006, the Asian College of Technology - International Educational Foundation (ACT-IEF) was incorporated for the establishment of additional colleges and diversification of curricular offerings.
            
            In 2007, ACT/ACT-IEF reached greater heights with the construction of a half-billion-peso, 15-storey building aptly called the ACT Cyber Tower. Powered by the technology of the future, this new home of ACT Cebu City Campus is the most modern educational infrastructure at the hub of the bustling Cebu City.</p>
